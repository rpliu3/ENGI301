This project aims to design a PCB for the project completed in Project_01. The PCB will contain key components such as the PocketBeagle, buttons, USB connection for the audio dongle, level shifter to stabilize the signal going to the LED strip, and 3 pin 100 mil header connection for the LED strip. 
All files needed to create the PCB are contained in the Eagle sub-folder.
